                    </header>
                    <p>
                        To be successful in today's disruptive business environment is not easy. But by deploying a
                        DevOps model with the right IT infrastructure, your ideas can quickly become reality and put you
                        ahead of the competition. Here's how HPE 3PAR StoreServ flash storage can make that happen.
                        In our technology-driven world, it takes more than good ideas to be successful. Uber, for
                        example, didn’t need to invent a new technology to build its business. The company just took3PAR
                        DevOps Blog.jpg advantage of the explosion of smartphones and mobile applications to design a
                        compelling customer experience and invent a new way of doing business.
                        But this isn’t just about Uber being able to execute a good idea. It’s also about the inability
                        of the cab industry to act quickly to transform its own business models to compete. Did they
                        have time to respond to the market disruption that Uber represents? Absolutely. But they needed
                        an IT infrastructure that would allow them to pivot when the inevitable disruption arrived and
                        they didn’t have that. The lesson here is: Whether you are a Fortune 50 or 1000 company,
                        everyone is at risk of missing a market opportunity, not securing their enterprise, and being
                        disrupted by a new idea or business model.

                    <p>
                        Success today is defined by the ability to turn ideas into value faster than your competition, how quickly you can experiment, fail fast, learn fast, test, tune and make it better. The behavior of developers is to make changes and enhance the application to generate revenue streams. Operations, on the other hand, is all about stability and reliability to keep business running 24/7. So how can you reconcile these two conflicting views and reduce friction between the teams? Enter DevOps.
                        DevOps is not a technology but it is a process and a mindset change to promote collaboration between Dev and Ops teams. According to research from Puppet Labs, IT organizations embracing DevOps deploy 200x more frequently, have 24x faster recovery times, 3x lower failure rates and spend 22% less time on unplanned work and rework. This is not a coincidence because these organizations have implemented a process of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI and CD) where every step of the application lifecycle from development to deployment is automated with feedback loops for continuous improvement.

                        <h2>The path to success is not always easy. There are numerous IT challenges to overcome, like these:</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Time-consuming infrastructure provisioning: Because of the complex IT process, developers often have to wait several days or weeks before getting their hands-on necessary IT infrastructure to develop and test applications. To cut through the IT red tape, developers go to the cloud where they can access the desired infrastructure in a matter of minutes with few clicks. This creates undesired shadow IT effect.
                        Disparity between Dev and Ops environments: For good reasons, Development (Dev) and Production (Ops) environments are often kept separate so it is not uncommon to find variance between those environments. It may not always be possible for the Ops teams to provide the Dev team access to the production environment and it is too time consuming to copy production datasets over to Dev environments which leaves developers with stale datasets to test against. Therefore, an application that worked fine on a Dev environment may or may not work in Ops. This can lead to longer release and bug fix cycles, customer dissatisfaction, revenue impact and ultimately finger pointing between Dev and Ops teams which erodes trust.
                        Safety-at-all-cost approach: How often do we see a newer version of an OS or a database come to market? Few and far between, right? That is because enterprises have the mindset of fewer but stable application releases to avoid failing in production. This also means slower time-to-market and the risk of being disrupted.
