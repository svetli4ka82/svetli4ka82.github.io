                        Time-consuming infrastructure provisioning: Because of the complex IT process, developers often have to wait several days or weeks before getting their hands-on necessary IT infrastructure to develop and test applications. To cut through the IT red tape, developers go to the cloud where they can access the desired infrastructure in a matter of minutes with few clicks. This creates undesired shadow IT effect.
                        Disparity between Dev and Ops environments: For good reasons, Development (Dev) and Production (Ops) environments are often kept separate so it is not uncommon to find variance between those environments. It may not always be possible for the Ops teams to provide the Dev team access to the production environment and it is too time consuming to copy production datasets over to Dev environments which leaves developers with stale datasets to test against. Therefore, an application that worked fine on a Dev environment may or may not work in Ops. This can lead to longer release and bug fix cycles, customer dissatisfaction, revenue impact and ultimately finger pointing between Dev and Ops teams which erodes trust.
                        Safety-at-all-cost approach: How often do we see a newer version of an OS or a database come to market? Few and far between, right? That is because enterprises have the mindset of fewer but stable application releases to avoid failing in production. This also means slower time-to-market and the risk of being disrupted.
